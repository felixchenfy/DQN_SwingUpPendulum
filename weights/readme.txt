This folder is for storing the whole model of Neural Network (structure and weights).

When running "python3 src/run_this.py",
the program will search this folder for loading the pre-trained model (If you set --retrain to False).
After training finishes,
the new model will also be saved here.

Note that this folder is just for temporary storing.
I've copied my final results to the "/FinalResults" folder.
